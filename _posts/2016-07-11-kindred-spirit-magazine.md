Kindred Spirit Magazine

## Introducing Kindred Spirit Mag 

Kindred Spirit magazine is an independent publication created by myself and fellow designer Helen Li. It is a culmination of two design students' love for the craft but ultimately it was inspired by the friendship forged between two "kindred spirits." The initial concept was born out of the frustration of attending a small, liberal arts college with limited resources. 

The first issue of Kindred Spirit focuses on local Boston coffee houses. Featured shops include Neighborhoods Coffee and Crepes, Pavement, Loyal Nine, Ogawa Coffee, and Gracenote Coffee. Helen and I created all of the magazine's content ourselves, including the editorial design, the photography, and the copywriting. 

The magazine is printed on matte paper, perfect bound in full color. This issue is 36 pages with a limited run of 50 copies. The print vendor is Boston Business Printing. Body copy is set in Adobe Garamond Pro. Display type is set in Futura. View the first issue here.
