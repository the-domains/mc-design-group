Snapchat Community Geofilters

Snapchat encourages artists and designers to create Geofilters for their communities. Since Snapchat introduced this feature on its app I've been fascinated by the filters I find in the places where I live and travel! I've designed two geofilters that have been activated by Snapchat, one in Boston's Fenway neighborhood and another in Sydney's Newtown precinct in NSW. I have lived in the Fenway for 3 years and I wanted to capture the spirit of the neighborhood in this Sox-inspired design. Similarly, I spent 6 months living abroad in Australia. My design for Newtown was inspired by one of the neighborhood's many murals. 

My Fenway design was activated by Snapchat in July 2015 and my Newtown design was activated in May 2016\. Anyone with the app can use either of these filters when they are in the greater Fenway or Newtown areas respectively. In January of 2016 my Fenway geofilter was briefly featured on one of Snapchat's billboard advertisements in Boston.
