**Fenway & Newtown Geofilters for Snapchat **

I've designed two geofilters that have been activated by Snapchat, one in Boston's Fenway neighborhood and another in Sydney's Newtown precinct in NSW. I have lived in the Fenway for 3 years and I wanted to capture the spirit of the neighborhood in this Sox-inspired design. Similarly, I spent 6 months living abroad in Australia. My design for Newtown was inspired by one of the neighborhood's many murals. 

My Fenway design was activated by Snapchat in July 2015 and my Newtown design was activated in May 2016\. Anyone with the app can use either of these filters when they are in the greater Fenway or Newtown areas respectively. In January of 2016 my Fenway geofilter was briefly featured on one of Snapchat's billboard [advertisements][0] in Boston.
