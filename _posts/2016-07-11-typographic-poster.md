Typographic Poster 

This poster was created as an undergraduate project for my sophmore Typography course at Simmons College. In the absence of photos or graphics, the poster showcases the type's unique 'shadows,' which function as the focal point of the piece. I drew on this distinct characteristic to emphasis the dimensional and edgy look of the letters. The informational side on the back features text from a research paper written in conjunction with the poster design. 

The assignment was to design a double-sided typographic poster inspired by a typeface of our choice. The conceptual side of the poster features the typeface Mr Robot designed by the Polish design duo Daniel Mizieliński and Aleksandra Machowiak Mizielińska, founders of Hippopotami Studio in Warsaw. This typeface was a gift from Daniel, whom I was lucky enough to meet during a 3 week study abroad course in Poland and Germany. Mr Robot courtesy of Hipoptam Studio.
